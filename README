                     simple dos-like scripting language

# why?

i always loved the simplicity of batch scripting in windows when i was but a wee
lad, now i want to bring back that happiness  by  bringing that same energy to a
new  custom programming language that  has more features which allows  it to  be
even more useful and thus even more fun.
